Just another Holloway repository.\n
I am a Gunner for life, wired for coffee, bugfree. The Holloway Club was born by a gaggle of workers at Dial Square armaments factory in Woolwich. Notable exiles, Scotsman David Danskin and Jack Humble, spear-headed the effort to form a football team to break the monotony of factory life.\n
Arsenal Football Club exists to make her fans proud.\n
In NYC, Arsenal Gunners watch all matches at Jack Doyle's in Midtown, O'Hanlons on 14th St, Paddy's of Park Slope and Highbury Pub in Brooklyn, Dunne's Pub in White Plains, and Finnegan's Pub in Hoboken. The closing of the 2018-19 Season saw the close of our long-time home The Blind Pig, known around the globe for its superb matchday atmosphere. We strive to maintain this atmosphere across all of our sites.
